# RSS feed reader

This is my pet-project to read an RSS feed of blogs I follow and save new posts into the database for later reading.

## Run locally

Locate the `TestRssFeedApplication` class and run the `main` method. That will run the Spring Application with
Postgres database running in the Testcontainers.
